✔ Through this practice, the fundamental concepts of NumPy have been clearly implemented.
✔ You successfully created and manipulated arrays in various dimensions (1D, 2D, multi-dimensional).
✔ Array reshaping, flattening, indexing, and slicing were performed, showing understanding of array structure.
✔ Essential mathematical operations such as addition, multiplication, mean, sum, min, max, and standard deviation were applied correctly.
✔ Random number generation was practiced, which is useful for simulations and testing data.
✔ The notebook shows a progressive approach to understanding how NumPy handles numerical data efficiently.
✔ Overall, this practice builds a strong foundation required for working with data in Python, especially for data analysis, scientific computing, and machine learning tasks.
